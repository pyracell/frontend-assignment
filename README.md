# Frontend Assignment

Fork this repository to answer the assignment.

## Description

For any given PNG image you should analyze the it to identify transparent and opaque tiles. Each tile should take up 1/10 of the image dimensions. For example, if the image is 1000x1200px each tile should be 100x120px.

You should end up with a HTML page where an user can upload any PNG image (see `xbox.png` in the repository for an example file), which is then visually shown to the user with the transparent tiles as green overlays and the opaque tiles as red overlays.

## Requirements

- Use canvas to analyze the image.
- Use Web Workers for background threading.

## Bonus Points

- Documentation.
- Unit tests.

Happy hacking :-)
